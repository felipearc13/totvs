In this tutorial, we will show you how to install GLPI on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. For those of you who didn’t know, GLPI is a free, open-source ITSM platform built with PHP designed to help you plan and easily manage your IT operations.

This article assumes you have at least basic knowledge of Linux, know how to use the shell, and most importantly, you host your site on your own VPS. The installation is quite simple and assumes you are running in the root account, if not you may need to add ‘`sudo`‘ to the commands to get root privileges. I will show you the step-by-step installation of GLPI on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa). You can follow the same instructions for Ubuntu 18.04, 16.04, and any other Debian-based distribution like Linux Mint.

## Install GLPI on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa

Step 1. First, make sure that all your system packages are up-to-date by running the following `apt` commands in the terminal.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Step 2. Installing the LAMP stack.

A Ubuntu 20.04 LAMP server is required. If you do not have LAMP installed, you can follow our guide [here](https://idroot.us/install-lamp-stack-ubuntu-20-04/).

Step 3. Installing GLPI on Ubuntu 20.04.

Now we download GLPI from the official website:

```
wget https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/download/10.0.0-beta/glpi-10.0.0-beta.tgz

tar xvf glpi-10.0.0-beta.tgz
```

Next, move the created `glpi` folder to the `/var/www/html`directory:

```
sudo mv glpi /var/www/html/
```

Now give proper permissions to the GLPI directory:

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
```

Step 4. Configuring MariaDB for GLPI.

By default, MariaDB is not hardened. You can secure MariaDB using the `mysql_secure_installation` script. you should read and below each step carefully which will set a root password, remove anonymous users, disallow remote root login, and remove the test database and access to secure MariaDB:

```
mysql_secure_installation
```

Configure it like this:

```
-  Set root password?  [Y/n] y 
-  Remove anonymous users?  [Y/n] y 
-  Disallow root login remotely?  [Y/n] y 
-  Remove test database and access to it?  [Y/n] y 
-  Reload privilege tables now?  [Y/n] y
```

Next, we will need to log in to the MariaDB console and create a database for GLPI. Run the following command:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

This will prompt you for a password, so enter your MariaDB root password and hit Enter. Once you are logged in to your database server you need to create a database for GLPI installation:

```
MariaDB  [(none)]> create database glpidb character set utf8mb4;  
MariaDB  [(none)]> grant all on glpidb.* to 'glpi'@'localhost' identified by  '321@pwR';  
MariaDB  [(none)]> flush privileges;  
MariaDB  [(none)]>  exit;
```

Step 5. Configuring Apache for GLPI.

Now we create a new virtual host directive in Apache. For example, create a new Apache configuration file named ‘`glpi.conf`’ on your virtual server:

```
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/glpi.conf
```

Add the following line:

```
<VirtualHost *:80> ServerAdmin admin@example.com DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
     ServerName 192.168.2.110
     ServerAlias www.your-domain.com <Directory  /var/www/html/> Options +FollowSymlinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted </Directory> ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
     CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined </VirtualHost>
```

Now, we can restart the Apache webserver so that the changes take place:

```
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2ensite yourls.conf 
sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
```

Step 6. Configure Firewall

In case, you enabled UFW firewall and firewall block requests of the apache web server, open a port in the firewall:

```
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

Step 7. Edit php.info

Backup php.ini archive:
```
sudo cp php.ini php.ini.bkp
```

Edit php.ini with nano: 
```
sudo nano /etc/php/8.0/apache2/php.ini
```

Uncoment:
```
extension=mysqli
extension=bz2
extension=curl
extension=fileinfo
extension=gd
extension=intl
extension=imap
extension=ldap
extension=mysqli
extension=openssl
extension=soap
extension=sodium
extension=xsl
````
Step 8. Accessing GLPI Web Interface.

GLPI will be available on HTTP port 80 by default. Open your favorite browser and navigate to `http://192.168.2.110/glpi/install/install.php` and complete the required steps to finish the installation.
